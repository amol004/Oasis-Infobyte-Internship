OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP

The focus of this internship was data science and analytics. On the Oasis Infobyte website, I submitted an application for this internship. I finished every duty they gave me. I have handed them 3 of the 5 assignments they have assigned us. Below is a list of all the assignments I've completed

Task-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION Using the provided parameters, including petal length, sepal length, petal width, and sepal width, I was able to identify the species of IRIS Flower. For the purpose of classifying species, I utilised Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.


TASK-3 CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING Numerous elements, like a car's features, horoscope, mileage, and brand reputation, affect a car's price, among many others. One of the main topics of machine learning research is the prediction of car prices. So this project is for you if you want to learn how to train a vehicle price prediction model.I forecasted car price using a Random Forest , XGBoost , Decision Tree.

Task-5: SALES PREDICTION Sales forecasting is the art of estimating how much of a product consumers will purchase depending on variables like the amount of money spent on promoting your product, the target market you target, or the platform you are using for your advertising. A product- and service-based company often needs a data scientist to forecast future sales with each decision they make to control the price of product promotion. Python was used to complete the machine learning objective of sales prediction.I forecasted revenues using a Random Forest , XGBoost , Decision Tree.
